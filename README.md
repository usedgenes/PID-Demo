This repository is a clone of the 2024 FTC SDK. It is meant to be an easy way for you to compare how a motor runs without PID, with the built in PID controller, and with a custom PID controller. 

Materials: Control Hub, Motor, an 8mm REX hub, a U-channel of any length, and some screws.

FTC Dashboard will be utilized to make tuning the PID coefficients easier.

Path for adb: 
    For single use: type set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\android-sdk-windows\platform-tools into command prompt
    For command prompt to remember the path: type echo %PATH% then setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\Program Files\android-sdk-windows\platform-tools" into command prompt, and type echo%PATH% every time you open command prompt
